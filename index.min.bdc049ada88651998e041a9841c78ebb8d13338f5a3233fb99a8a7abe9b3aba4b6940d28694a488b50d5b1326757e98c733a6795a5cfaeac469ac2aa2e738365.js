Intuitive
Creating and using passkeys is as simple as consenting to save and use them. No having to create a password.
Automatically unique per-service
By design, passkeys are unique per-service. There’s no chance to reuse them.
Breach-resistant
A passkey is only stored on a user’s devices. RP servers store public keys. Even servers that assist in the syncing of passkeys across a user’s devices never have the ability to view or use the private keys for a user\u0026rsquo;s passkeys.
Phishing-resistant
Rather than trust being rooted in a human who has to verify they’re signing into the right website or app, browser, and operating systems enforce that passkeys are only ever used for the appropriate service.

There is no browser artifact (such as a cookie or a credential ID in local storage) available to the relying party, although for now we assume that the user has an existing account with the relying party.
To bootstrap an account, serve the user a sign-in page.
Start off by asking the user for their account identifier, typically a username or email address:
To support the autofill UI for passkeys, make sure to:
Add the username and webauthn value to any existing autocomplete annotations on the username input field as shown below in the example.
\u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;label for=\u0026quot;username\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Username:\u0026lt;/label\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input name=\u0026quot;username\u0026quot; id=\u0026quot;loginform.username\u0026quot; autocomplete=\u0026quot;username webauthn\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; On page load, check to see if conditional mediation (autofill UI) is supported using an if statement, then call navigator.credentials.get() with mediation: \u0026quot;conditional\u0026quot; and userVerification: \u0026quot;required\u0026quot;.
if (navigator.credentials.conditionalMediationSupported) { navigator.credentials.get({ mediation: \u0026quot;conditional\u0026quot;, publicKey: { challenge: ..., // server generated challenge value rpId: ..., // RP's domain name userVerification: \u0026quot;required\u0026quot;, } }); } This will cause the following to happen:
When the user interacts with the username field, the browser and platform will check whether a passkey exists in the platform authenticator that can be used with the relying party. If this is the case, the passkey will be presented to the user as an option to choose (along with other credentials that can be auto-filled, such as usernames stored in the browser’s password manager). The browser/platform might render a UI similar to the one shown below, although the exact look and feel will vary from platform to platform (Windows vs. Android vs. iOS), and from form factor to form factor (desktop vs. mobile): If the user selects the passkey, the platform UI will guide the user through a (often biometrics-based) user verification check.
If the user successfully passes the user verification, the navigator.credentials.get() succeeds and returns a WebAuthn response.
If the user selects a credential other than a passkey, the browser/platform chooses a different appropriate action (such as auto-filling the username), and the navigator.credentials.get() call does not resolve.
If the user selects the \u0026ldquo;Passkey from another device\u0026rdquo; option (NOTE: the exact text will vary slightly by platform), then the browser/platform will guide the user through using a FIDO2 security key or the Cross-Device Authentication (CDA) flow to use a passkey from their smartphone or tablet to deliver a WebAuthn response to the navigator.credentials.get() call.
This is why this is called the Conditional UI (often called the Autofill UI) mode of WebAuthn — the platform authenticator UI that guides the user through the verification, or through using their phone, is only shown if the user has a passkey on this device (or chooses the \u0026ldquo;another device\u0026rdquo; option).
As we can see, in this mode the navigator.credentials.get() call either succeeds, or it doesn’t (never resolves). If it does succeed, then the result of the call will reveal both a user id, as well as a signed WebAuthn assertion, which the relying party will use to authenticate the user.
If the call doesn’t succeed, perform a \u0026ldquo;legacy\u0026rdquo; user authentication: you’ll get a username from this first page, and you then serve appropriate further login challenges (such as passwords, responding to SMS challenges, etc.) to the user in subsequent pages. These may include \u0026ldquo;account recovery\u0026rdquo; steps in case the user has forgotten their password or is otherwise not able to pass the regular login challenges. Once the user has passed all the login challenges, they’re considered authenticated and signed in.
What happens when the user doesn’t already have an account with the relying party? Usually, you will give users the option on the sign-in page to create an account. If the user chooses that option, collect the necessary information from the user to open a new account. If the user successfully opens a new account, they’re also considered authenticated and signed-in.
Once the user is signed in, it might be time to set up a new passkey for them. Do this for any of the following cases:
The user bootstrapped their account on the device by passing non-passkey login challenges (such as using a password). The user just created a new account at the relying party, and is considered signed-in because of that. The user was using a passkey, but they used a different device than the one they’re currently on (by selecting the \u0026ldquo;other device\u0026rdquo; shown in the example above). This can be checked by inspecting the authenticatorAttachment attribute in the returned PublicKeyCredential object. Setting up a new passkey for these cases is in the next session.
Opting the user into passkeys #First check whether the two calls below return true.
PublicKeyCredential.isUserVerifyingPlatformAuthenticatorAvailable() navigator.credentials.conditionalMediationSupported If they are, then the user\u0026rsquo;s system features a FIDO platform authenticator that supports conditional UI mode, and you can offer the user the convenience and security of using passkeys.
Serve an opt-in or \u0026ldquo;upsell\u0026rdquo; modal/interstitial or page to the user offering them to create a passkey:
If the user has signed in with a passkey from a another device (such as a phone, tablet, or FIDO2 security key), you might adjust the wording accordingly:
Consider showing (or linking to) longer descriptions explaining that all users that are able to unlock the current device will be able to access the account at the relying party to ensure that the user is giving fully informed consent.
If the user consents, call navigator.credentials.create(), making sure to ask for a platform authenticator, user verification, discoverable credentials (aka \u0026ldquo;resident keys\u0026rdquo;), and passing an exclude list of existing passkeys for the account:
navigator.credentials.create({ publicKey: { rp: { ...}, user: { ...}, challenge: ..., pubKeyCredParams: [ { \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;public-key\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;alg\u0026quot;: -7 // EC P256 }, { \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;public-key\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;alg\u0026quot;: -257 // RSA } ], excludeCredentials: [ { // other passkeys (i.e., credentials) tied to the user account type: \u0026quot;public-key\u0026quot;, id: new UInt8Array([21, 31, 56, ...]).buffer, }, { type: \u0026quot;public-key\u0026quot;, id: new UInt8Array([21, 31, 56, ...]).buffer, }, { ... } ], authenticatorSelection: { authenticatorAttachment: \u0026quot;platform\u0026quot;, residentKey: \u0026quot;required\u0026quot;, userVerification: \u0026quot;required\u0026quot; }, } }) A note on attestation: We recommend that most relying parties not specify the attestation conveyance parameter attestation (thus defaulting to none), or instead explicitly use the value indirect. This guarantees the most streamlined user experience (platforms are likely to obtain consent from the user for other types of attestation conveyances, which likely results in a larger fraction of unsuccessful credential creations due to users canceling the creation).
When the WebAuthn call resolves, send the response to your server and associate the returned public key and credential ID with the user account.
`}),e.add({id:4,href:"/docs/use-cases/reauth/",title:"Reauthentication",description:"Performing a reauthentication with passkeys",content:`Reauthentication might happen for the following reasons:
The user signed out and now wants to sign in again The user session expired due to inactivity, and the user wants to sign in again The user is about to perform a sensitive action, and needs to re-confirm control over the user session You’ll use passkeys that you set up in the previous section to reauthenticate the user in each of these situations. The WebAuthn API call is the same in all three cases, but the UI treatment that you provide is slightly different. Since the particular account is specified by you, the platform will not offer the user to select a different account on your service.
Sensitive Actions #Let’s look at the UI for the last case first: when it’s time to re-authenticate for a sensitive action, check whether you have a credential ID for at least one passkey for the user.
If no such credential ID is available, serve a traditional login challenge suitable for reauthentication, for example:
We recommend that on this login challenge page, users can’t change their account identifier. Also, the login challenge should be something that an unauthorized user of the device can’t pass.
If, however, you do find at least one passkey credential ID for the user, then you can use passkeys for reauthentication:
When the user is ready (in the above example, when they click on the \u0026ldquo;Go\u0026rdquo; button), call navigator.credentials.get(), passing in all the user’s passkey credential IDs:
navigator.credentials.get({ publicKey: { challenge: ..., rpId: ..., allowCredentials: [{ type: \u0026quot;public-key\u0026quot;, id: new UInt8Array([21, 31, 56, ...]).buffer, }, { type: \u0026quot;public-key\u0026quot;, id: new UInt8Array([21, 31, 56, ...]).buffer, }, { ... }], userVerification: \u0026quot;required\u0026quot;, } }); If the user instead clicks on \u0026ldquo;Try another way\u0026rdquo;, you should offer them other sign in methods (password, etc.) to reauthenticate them (assuming the user has such other sign in methods available to them).
Expired Sessions and Logout #Now let’s look at the case where the reauthentication is triggered because the user logged themselves out, or the relying party expired the user\u0026rsquo;s session. To facilitate this, the relying party would have to keep some form of user session state reminding them of the account that used to be signed in, even when they consider the user signed-out (this could be acheived using browser artifacts such as cookies or local storage).
Note that a relying party may choose to treat signing-out as a comprehensive action and thus delete all references to the user’s identity. Such a relying party ought to treat a subsequent sign-in like an account bootstrap, and repeat the steps explained above.
You, as the relying party, might then serve a sign-in page like this:
If the user clicks on \u0026ldquo;Use a different account\u0026rdquo;, then you should enter an account bootstrap flow as explained on the previous page, repeating the steps in Bootstrapping an account, where the platform will let them select which account they want to use.
In this case, you should also give the user the ability to completely remove the suggested account from being listed on the sign-in page.
But if the user clicks the \u0026ldquo;Sign in as\u0026rdquo; button, check whether you have at least one passkey credential ID associated with the user. If no credential ID is available, serve a traditional login challenge suitable for reauthentication, for example:
If, however, you do find at least one passkey credential ID for the user, then you can use passkeys for reauthentication:
When the user is ready (in the above example, when they click on the “Go!” button), call navigator.credentials.get(), exactly as shown above (i.e., by passing in all the user’s passkey credential IDs).
If the user instead clicks on \u0026ldquo;Try another way\u0026rdquo;, you should offer them other sign in methods (password, etc.) to reauthenticate them.

`}),e.add({id:14,href:"/docs/reference/terms/",title:"Terms",description:"A list of terms which are used frequently throughout this site and in discussions about passkeys, FIDO2, and WebAuthn.",content:`2FA user #A user whose account has 2FA turned on, i.e., who must present 2 authentication factors during sign-in.
2-Factor Authentication (2FA) #also sometimes referred to as MFA: multi-factor authentication or 2SV: two-step verification
This refers to a contract between a user and a Relying Party (RP) where the RP must collect at least two distinct authentication factors from the user during a bootstrap sign-in.
Account boostrapping #A Relying Party (RP) authenticates a user without any prior knowledge of who the user is. This means that the RP not only has to verify the identity of the user (checking the password, verifying cryptographic signatures, etc), it also has to establish the identity of the user (figure out the user id, username, etc. of the user who’s signing in). This may happen when a user signs into an existing account for the first time on a newly-purchased device; or when a user logs into a website for the first time in a given browser instance. Or when a user logs into a website in a private browsing session. Or when a user signs into a mobile app for the first time on a given device (contrast this with reauthentication below).
Note that this is different from creating an account with a service in the first place.
Authentication factor #Information provided by a user (or one of the user’s devices) for purposes of authentication, usually in response to a login challenge. Often categorized into \u0026ldquo;knowledge factors\u0026rdquo; (e.g. passwords), \u0026ldquo;something you have\u0026rdquo; factors (e.g. another already signed-in device), and \u0026ldquo;something you are\u0026rdquo; factors (e.g. biometrics). Note that a single login challenge may collect multiple factors simultaneously.
Cross-Device Authentication (CDA) #FIDO Cross-Device Authentication (CDA) allows a passkey from one device to be used to sign in on another device. For example, your phone can be linked to your laptop, allowing you to use a passkey from your phone to sign into a service on your laptop.
CDA is powered by the FIDO Client-to-Authenticator Protocol (CTAP) using \u0026ldquo;hybrid\u0026rdquo; transport. CTAP is implemented by authenticators and client platforms, not Relying Parties.
Device Public Key (DPK) #A Device Public Key (DPK) is a device-bound key that can be requested by a Relying Party (RP) for higher assurance scenarios where device contintuity signals are desired. If supported by the authenticator, a signature from both the passkey and DPK are returned.
Example: Say that a sign-in request appears at a website along with some geolocation signal that has not been seen for this user account before, and is outside of the typical usage hours observed for the account. The risk may be deemed high enough not to allow the request, even with an assertion by a passkey on its own. But if a signature by a device-bound key that is well established for this user can also be presented, then that may tip the balance.
Just like a passkey, DPKs are unique to each RP.
Spec Reference (L3 Draft) Discoverable Credential #A Discoverable Credential (previously known as a \u0026ldquo;resident credential\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;resident key\u0026rdquo;) is a FIDO2/WebAuthn credential that is entirely stored in the authenticator (private key, credential ID, user handle, and other metadata). The Relying Party (RP) also stores a copy of the public key and credential ID
Passkeys (and single-device passkeys) are Discoverable Credentials.
In contrast, a non-discoverable credential (also known as a U2F credential) is encrypted by the authenticator and stored by the RP. The RP must know something about the user in advance, typically a username, in order to request an assertion for the credential from the authenticator.
Many deployments that predate passkeys use non-discoverable credentials for a second factor.
Spec Reference Login challenge #A prompt served to the user that they need to satisfy.
Examples:
a prompt asking the user for their password a prompt asking the user to confirm sign-in on another device (e.g., their phone) a prompt asking the user to insert and activate their security key Account bootstrapping and reauthentication usually consist of serving the user one or more login challenges.
Logging in #see Signing in.
Passkey #sometimes referred to as a multi-device passkey
Short version:
A passkey is a FIDO2 Discoverable Credential that requires user verification and is protected against device loss.
Longer version:
A FIDO2/WebAuthn credential that can reliably be used for bootstrap sign-in, without requiring other login challenges such as passwords. \u0026ldquo;Reliable\u0026rdquo; here means that the passkey should be available to, and usable by, the user whenever they need to sign in. This availability can be achieved through different means: for example, platforms could restore passkeys from a backup whenever a user sets up a new device, offer passkeys across different contexts (a passkey established from an app can be used in the browser when visiting the app’s website), or allow users to exercise passkeys across devices (by, say, using the passkey from a nearby phone when signing in from a laptop).
The important thing is that a passkey is there when the user needs it, and that it can be used without other login challenges. A WebAuthn credential that was created in a private browsing context and disappears when that browsing context is dismissed would not be considered a passkey (since it won’t be there for the user next time they’re trying to sign in). Nor would a U2F credential on a security key (since it requires additional factors for sign-in).
Platform authenticator #A FIDO authenticator that is built-in to a user\u0026rsquo;s device.
Spec Reference Reauthentication #Reauthentication happens when a Relying Party (RP) already knows who the user is, but would like to reconfirm this.
For example, this can happen before making sensitive changes to an account (adding a recovery email address, changing authentication methods, etc.): a relying party would typically ask the user to re-enter their password or perform some other action to reconfirm their control of the session. Likewise, when a mobile app asks the user to sign in every time the app starts (or a web site asks the user to sign in again after a period of inactivity), this is technically a reauthentication, since the app or web site can choose to remember the user\u0026rsquo;s identity after the account has been bootstrapped on the device (using things like cookies or local storage).
Relying Party (RP) #The website that is trying to ascertain and verify the identity of the user or perform FIDO authentication.
Spec Reference Roaming authenticator #A FIDO authenticator usable with any device the user is trying to sign-in from. Roaming authenticators attach to users\u0026rsquo; devices in using USB, NFC, and/or Bluetooth. These authenticators are often referred to as \u0026ldquo;security keys\u0026rdquo;. A smartphone can also act as a roaming authenticator using FIDO Cross-Device Authentication.
Spec Reference Signing in #This can refer to either account bootstrapping or reauthentication.
Single-device passkey #A FIDO2 Discoverable Credential that requires user verification and is bound to a single authenticator. For example, FIDO2 security keys hold single-device passkeys as the credential cannot leave the device.
User Presence (UP) #A test of User Presence (UP) is used to ensure the user is in local proximity to the authenticator during an authentication or credential creation ceremony. UP is often satisifed by pressing a button or metallic area of a security key, or interacting with a platform authenticator on a device.
Spec Reference User Verification (UV) #User Verification (UV) requires the user to either perform a biometric guesture or enter the device PIN for the authenticator to authorize creation and use of the credential. In some cases, UV also satifies a test of User Presence (such as when the authenticator itself has a biometric built-in or the device PIN is entered directly into the authenticator).
Spec Reference User-Verifying Roaming Authenticator #A User-Verifying Roaming Authentication (UVRA), also known as a first-factor roaming authenticator, can verify individual users through the use of biometrics, or through the user entering a device PIN. An important class of UVRAs are smartphones, in which case the “attachment” typically happens over a wireless connection.
Spec Reference `}),e.add({id:15,href:"/docs/reference/specs/",title:"Specifications",description:"List of specifications that enable passkeys",content:`The two primary technical specifications that work together to enable passkeys are Web Authentication, commonly referred to as WebAuthn, and the Client to Authenticator Protocol (CTAP), commonly referred to as FIDO2.
