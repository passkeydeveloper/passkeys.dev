    {{< card title="Intuitive" icon="fa-solid fa-wand-magic-sparkles" align="center">}}
        Creating and using passkeys is as simple as consenting to save and use them. No having to create a password.
    {{< /card >}}
    {{< card title="Automatically unique" icon="fa-regular fa-snowflake" align="center">}}
        By design, passkeys are unique per-service. There’s no chance to reuse them.

        A passkey is only stored on a user’s devices. [Relying Party (RP)](/docs/reference/terms/#relying-party-rp) servers store public keys. Even servers that assist in the syncing of passkeys across a user’s devices never have the ability to view or use the private keys for a user's passkeys.

        Rather than trust being rooted in a human who has to verify they’re signing into the right website or app, browsers and operating systems enforce that passkeys are only ever used for the appropriate service.

> The guidance on this site is currently targeted towards sites and services that are using either password only or password + OTP (SMS, app TOTP, app push, magic link) sign in flows. Future guidance will include more advanced and higher assurance scenarios.
