        the markdown list syntax for each item. If the entire article is relevant, just link to the
        permalink for its source or the live page. If only a section of the article is relevant, use
        the permalink to the lines for the most relevant section of the source or the anchor link to
        the nearest header for the relevant content instead of the page itself.
